# Overview

The Gevulot devnet, our first major release, is a permissioned network for testing the proof generation pipeline and other core functionalityâ€”including deployment, proving, verifying, networking, and orchestration.

The devnet offers the following functionality:

1. Deploy arbitrary provers and verifiers
2. Run proving workloads to generate and verify proofs
3. Track workload status, cancel, and retrieve outputs via an API.
4. Store proofs&#x20;

Devnet nodes are currently operated by [Supranational](https://www.supranational.net/), [P2P.org](https://p2p.org/), [Staking Facilities](https://stakingfacilities.com/) & [RockawayX Infrastructure.](https://rockawayx.com/infrastructure)\
