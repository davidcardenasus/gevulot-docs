# Overview

The Gevulot Devnet, our first major release, will be a permissioned network for testing the proof generation pipeline and other core functionalityâ€”including deployment, proving, verifying, networking, and orchestration.

The devnet offers the following functionality:

1. Deploy arbitrary provers and verifiers
2. Run proving workloads to generate and verify proofs
3. Track workload status, cancel, and retrieve outputs via an API.
4. Store proofs&#x20;
