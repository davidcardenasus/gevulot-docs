# Overview

The Gevulot devnet is a permissioned network for high performance proof generation. It provides the full proof generation pipelineâ€”including deployment, proving, verifying, networking, and orchestration. It is also highly redudant, so as long as one node remains online users can generate proofs.&#x20;

The devnet offers the following functionality:

1. Deploy arbitrary provers and verifiers
2. Run proving workloads to generate and verify proofs
3. Track workload status and retrieve outputs via an API.
4. Store proofs&#x20;

Devnet nodes are currently operated by [Supranational](https://www.supranational.net/), [P2P.org](https://p2p.org/), [Staking Facilities](https://stakingfacilities.com/) & [RockawayX Infrastructure.](https://rockawayx.com/infrastructure)\
\
The Gevulot devnet is launching March 25th. [Sign up for access](https://www.gevulot.com/).

Note that currently single proving or verifying step can take 30 minutes at maximum, until it's forcefully stopped.
