# Overview

We believe in a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) future where proving is fast, cheap, and truly decentralized. ZkCloud has been designed with this vision in mind. It is the first universal proving infrastructure for ZK that allows users to generate proofs for any proof system at a fraction of the cost.

We are building a protocol that enables new applications utilizing provable compute to become economically viable. It also ensures prover nodes can achieve the highest possible resource efficiency by aggregating workloads from across the industry.

A unique feature of ZkCloud is that it allows for centralized-equivalent proving performance while providing the high liveness and availability guarantees common in decentralized networks. The network achieves this through its innovative dual-node architecture, specifically optimized for proof generation and verification, and its extremely simple consensus mechanism, which enables fair and efficient distribution of workloads and rewards.

The two primary node types in ZkCloud are provers and validators. At a high level, users broadcast proving workloads, validators process transactions and order them into blocks, and provers complete proving workloads and verify proofs.

ZkCloud allows users to specify their desired amount of redundancy as per their priorities. The protocol also leverages maximum parallelization of computation at both the node and network levels. This parallel processing capability significantly boosts the network's efficiency and scalability, allowing nodes to run multiple provers and verifiers simultaneously. As a result, the network can handle various provers working on distinct proofs at the same time.

The network's design promises several advantages, including liveness guarantees, high censorship resistance, low and predictable fees, and efficient workload distribution among multiple provers.
