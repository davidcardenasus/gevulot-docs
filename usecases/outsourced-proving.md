# Outsourced Proving

Modern validity rollups and other services which need to compute proofs can use Gevulot to outsource their proving. Where in many cases projects would need to either bootstrap their own prover networks or rely on their sequencers to manage heavy computational loads, with Gevulot they can simply deploy a prover.
