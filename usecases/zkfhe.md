Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows for computing on encrypted data, without revealing the underlying data. Recently there has been increased exploration into utilizing zero-knowledge proofs for proving the computations performed on the cyphertext. This is a great use case for Gevulot. A user encrypts the data, passes it as an input to a prover program, which runs some computation on the encrypted data and then returns a proof.
