# ZK Coprocessors

Zk Coprocessors are a category of application that is growing quickly. The core idea is that smart contracts can utilize heavy computation, which would be infeasible to do on-chain due to cost considerations, by offloading the work to a Zk Coprocessor. These coprocessors do the work off-chain and generate a proof, which can then be verified on-chain.
