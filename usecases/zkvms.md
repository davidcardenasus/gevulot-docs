# ZkVMs

There are already tens of zkVM implementations including [CairoVM](https://crates.io/crates/cairo-vm), [Risc0](https://www.risczero.com/), [Wasm0](https://github.com/wasm0), [zkBPF](https://github.com/Eclipse-Laboratories-Inc/zk-bpf), [zkEVMs](https://github.com/LuozhuZhang/awesome-zkevm). Any such zkVM implementation can be deployed on Gevulot and used as a standalone environment when combined with some state storage system.
