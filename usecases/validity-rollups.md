# Validity Rollups

Modern validity rollups leverage Gevulot to delegate proving tasks. Traditionally, projects had to either establish their own networks of  provers or rely on their sequencers to handle intensive computations. However, with Gevulot they can easily deploy a prover to manage the computational demands.
