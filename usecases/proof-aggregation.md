# Proof Aggregation

Many rollup systems have a need to aggregate a large number of smaller proofs into one aggregate proof. For example, a privacy rollup like [Aztec](https://aztec.network/), which needs to aggregate a large number of private proofs into one aggregate proof could use Gevulot for the aggregation while retaining its desired privacy guarantees.
