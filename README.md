# Introduction

Gevulot is the first decentralised proving layer for the modular stack. It is designed to greatly decrease the cost of proving by aggregating workloads from across all usecases, allowing it to optimally utilize the underlying hardware. The core value proposition of Gevulot can be summarized as follows:

1. Low costs
2. High performance
3. High liveness & availability guarantees
4. Permissionless access

These docs describe the current network design and how to develop or interact with the network.

The current status of the project is pre-alpha.
