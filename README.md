# Introduction

Gevulot is a generic decentralised prover network, designed for deploying arbitrary provers as on-chain programs, while maintaining performance similar to centralised provers. The vision of Gevulot is to make the creation of performant zk-based systems, such as validity rollups, as easy as deploying smart contracts.

These docs describe the current network design and how to develop or interact with the network.

The current status of the project is pre-alpha.
