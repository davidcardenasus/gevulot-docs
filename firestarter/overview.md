Firestarter is a high-performance compute network optimized for ZK. It is designed to scale to thousands of prover nodes handling both CPU and GPU workloads, as well as incorporate new hardware as that becomes available. Users can generate proofs using one of the pre-deployed provers, such as Risc0, SP1, Nexus, Aztec, ZKsync, Starkware, Linea & Polygon or by deploying their own.&#x20;

Under the hood, Firestarter is an end-to-end implementation of Gevulotâ€™s ZkCloud, just running in a permissioned fashion. The full system is made up of a blazingly fast CometBFT-based chain, which handles Credits, workload allocation and monitoring, and a network of prover nodes that provide compute for generating and verifying zk proofs.
