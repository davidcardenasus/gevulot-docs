In Firestarter compute fees are paid in Credits. The amount of Credits you need for any given workload depends on the workload-specific resource requirements, such as CPU cores, RAM, GPU and compute time. The users set these parameters as they submit a workload and are only charged for the resources and compute time used.

To purchase credits first [create an account](get-started/create-account.md) and then head over to [gevulot.com](https://www.gevulot.com/pricing) to purchase. Follow the instructions on the page to purchase and then submit your account key for credit distribution.
