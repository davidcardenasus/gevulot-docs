# Create Account

Install the latest `gvltctl` tool from [releases](https://github.com/gevulotnetwork/gvltctl/releases/latest).&#x20;

Generate an account by

```sh
gvltctl keygen
```

The tool will output an address and a secret mnemonic for the key:

```
gvlt1fkghugffl0v6kw8jfzznjgpd6tzl7e8xhy6un8
fantasy vicious elegant uphold issue trend dismiss length rough add cram key switch mixed pave argue monitor feel supply demand absorb victory catch soap
```

Store the mnemonic _securely_ for later use. In **no** circumstances you should lose or reveal the mnemonic to any outsider.
