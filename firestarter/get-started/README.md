# Get Started

To start using Firestarter for proof generation and verification you need to [register a key](create-account.md) and purchase [Credits](purchase-credits.md) for your account.\
\
Once you have some Credits, you can [run workloads](../run-workloads/) on one of the pre-deployed provers or [deploy a prover](../deploy-provers/).
