# Get Started

To start using Firestarter for proof generation and verification you need to [create an account](create-account.md) and purchase [Credits](purchase-credits.md).\
\
Once you have some Credits, you can [run workloads](../run-workloads/) on a deployed prover or [deploy a prover](../deploy-provers/).
