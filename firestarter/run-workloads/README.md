# Run Workloads

Running workload on Gevulot is split into two basic concepts: Tasks and Workflows.

[Task](tasks.md) is the basic building block describing an individual program execution.

[Workflow](workflows.md) is the basic building block to structure the orchestration of execution of multiple Tasks.
