# Prover Deployment

As of the launch of Firestarter, there's no need for specific prover deployment. The prover VM image must be hosted on an HTTP server and the URL to the image must be referenced in the corresponding _Task_ descriptor.

**NOTE:** The VM image URL must be available & accessible as long as _Tasks_ are run using that image!
